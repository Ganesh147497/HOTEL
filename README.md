Hotel Booking Data Analysis

This project analyzes a hotel booking dataset to uncover key trends, root causes behind cancellations, and actionable business recommendations.
The goal is to simulate real-world data analysis performed by a Data Analyst for business decision-making.

The dataset contains hotel booking records including:

   Booking channels
   Room types
   Lead time
   Cancellation status
   Stay duration
   Average Daily Rate (ADR)
   Guest details and special requests

1)KEY OBSERVATIONS
    A) Meaningful Trends & Patterns:
        
Trend 1: Long Lead-Time Bookings Have Higher Cancellations  
		Bookings made far in advance show a significantly higher cancellation rate, indicating uncertainty in early travel planning.

Trend 2: City Hotels Face More Cancellations Than Resort Hotels
            City hotels experience more frequent cancellations due to flexible business travel, while resort hotels show more stable vacation-based bookings.
Trend 3: High-ADR Bookings Cancel More Often
            Bookings with higher average daily rates tend to cancel more, suggesting price sensitivity and competitive price comparison.

B) Booking Patterns Across Channels, Room Types & Ratings
    Booking Channels:
         Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) generate higher booking volume but also higher cancellation rates.
         Direct bookings show lower cancellations and higher booking reliability.
Room Types:
   Standard rooms are the most frequently booked and relatively stable.
 Premium and suite rooms have higher cancellation risk due to higher pricing.
Star Ratings / Property Quality (Inferred):
Higher-end properties command higher ADRs and expectations, which can lead to increased cancellations if perceived value is not met.
	 
C) Cancellation Behavior:
            Most cancellations occur before the arrival date.
             Bookings without deposits are canceled more frequently.
             Guests with special requests and repeat guests show much lower cancellation rates.
2)	Root Cause Analysis:
     >  Reasons Behind Cancellation Patterns
     > Long lead times create planning uncertainty.
     > Flexible or free cancellation policies.
     > Price sensitivity and competitive offers.
     > Business travel plan changes.
     Property Types:
             Resort hotels attract leisure travelers with fixed plans and longer stays.
             City hotels depend more on business travelers with flexible schedules
	3)Seasonal & Temporal Influences
       Peak seasons show:
                   Higher ADR
                   Longer stays
                   Lower cancellation rates   
       Off-seasons show:
                       Higher discounts
                       Shorter stays
                       Increased cancellations
                       Weekend bookings are more stable than weekday bookings.
   4) Business Recommendations
          Strategies to Reduce Cancellations:
                            Introduce partial or non-refundable deposits for early bookings.
                             Offer discounted non-refundable pricing options.
                             Improve pre-arrival communication and reminders.
                              Encourage special requests to increase booking commitment.
          Improving Profitability & Repeat Bookings:
                                                   Promote direct booking benefits (free breakfast, loyalty points).
                                                   Target repeat guests with personalized offers.
                                                   Upsell room upgrades, meal plans, and add-on services.			
	        Pricing, Promotion & Channel Optimization
                                          Pricing:
                                                 Implement dynamic pricing based on season and demand.
                                                 Offer slightly reduced ADR for non-refundable bookings.
                                         Promotions:
                                              Early-bird deals with partial commitment.
                                              Bundled off-season offers (stay + meals).
                                       Channel Strategy:
                                                       Reduce over-dependence on OTAs.
                                                       Strengthen direct booking platforms.
                                                       Optimize commission structures with OTAs
